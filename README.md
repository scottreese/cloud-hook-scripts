## What Are Cloud Hook Scripts?
This is a collection of functions, and a generic sample script with which to execute them, which leverage Cloud API to perform common tasks in response to Cloud events. This is meant to complement the Acquia Cloud Hooks package, https://github.com/acquia/cloud-hooks, by providing an extensible "plug and play" solution to help developers get started using Cloud Hooks and Cloud API in their projects.

## Usage
Follow the instructions to set up Cloud Hooks in your repository: https://github.com/acquia/cloud-hooks/blob/master/README.md. Further instructions TBD.
